1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It creates all the initial meta data for the repository.

Now, we can start work with our version control.

2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The Staging area does not contain versions of the same file, only the files
to be commited. So in that sense it is different from a ripository.

But, it does contain meta data such as which files to commit, data that
a working directory does not have.
